A set of Python scripts aimed at helping animators.  Useful especially for particle animation and similar animations.

The package contains the following scripts - 

1. Collision Checker 1.0 - This plugin makes collision checking a one click job. Just select the meshes you want to check , choose the frame range , and click ! It returns the frames in which
collision occurs. This aims at helping animators check for animation errors such as intersecting meshes. This uses the Maya API ( OpenMaya) for checking mesh intersections.

2. PathFinder 1.0 - This script aims at making animation and collision detection a bit easier for animators. It creates a path along the selected object for a selected range of keyframes. This
helps in better visualisation of animation , and makes checking for collisions easier.

Coded in Python for Autodesk Maya. Tested on Maya 2012.
