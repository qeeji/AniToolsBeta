PathFinder 1.0 
------------------------

PathFinder 1.0 is a simple script that is aimed at helping animators in obtaining accurate keyframe animators. It generates a path for any selected object. This helps in visualizing the animations
better , and also helps in narrowing down the locations of possible collisions between various objects. It is especially helpful in particle animation , where you need to deal with a lot of 
objects. Just run the script and it does the rest.

How It Works :
---------------------

1. Select the object you want to create a path for.
2. Run the script in the Maya script editor.
3. The script generates a path for the animation for the frame range.

Coded in Python for Autodesk Maya. Tested on Maya 2012.
